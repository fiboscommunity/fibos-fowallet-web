The FO Wallet provides QR authentication login feature, following the ```SimpleWallet ``` protocol. If you are not familiar with this protocol, get more information here:  [SimpleWallet protocol ](https://github.com/southex/SimpleWallet/blob/master/README.md)。

The specific process for using the login API is as follows:

### 1. Generate QR Code

Please use the following the JSON format below to generate a QR code image first.

```json
{
	protocol	string,   // protocol name, be used to differentiates protocols
    version     string,   // protocol version info, exp: 1.0
    dappName    string,   // name of dapp
    dappIcon    string,   // dapp logo
    action      string,   // asign to login
    uuID        string,   // genrenated by dapp server，be used for validate the unique sign of the login this time   
    loginUrl    string,   // be used for receiving the url of login authentication info
    expired	    number,   // expired time of QR code, Unix time stamp, exp:（ Date.now() + 300000 ）expired in 5 min
    loginMemo 	string,   // login note info, be used for showed up in wallet. optional.
}
```
Then, after the user uses the scan QR code feature of the wallet to scan the QR code generated from the steps above, the wallet will provide a signature to verify the login related data.

### 2. Signature Verification
After the wallet finishes signature signing, the address of the loginUrl provided in the QR code is used to inform the address of the dapp server used for accepting login authentication information. After the post request is approved, data in the following format is sent out.

```json
{
    protocol   string     // protocol name, wallet use this for differentiates the others. This protocol is FOWallet.
    version    string     // Protoctol version info. exp: 1.0
    timestamp  number     // current unix timestamp
    sign       string     // eos signature
    uuID       string     // generated by dapp server, be used for the unique sign of verify login this time.     
    account    string     // eos account name
    ref        string     // source, exp: wallet name
}
```
You can then verify the signature based on the data you receive.

Please use the way of signature validation provided by the ecc module of EOS to verify the signature, and use the following order to build the signature data that requires validation.

```js
let data = timestamp + account + uuID + ref     //ref is the name of wallet，show source.
ecc.verify(sign, data, pubkey)
```

After validation, your server end will need to give feedback to the wallet with the results of validation. Please return the result in the following format.

```json
// responsding data format 
{
    code number     // error code, 0 means success, the others means fault.
    error string    // error note
}
```
